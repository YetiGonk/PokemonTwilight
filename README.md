PokemonTwilight

A work-in-progress Pokemon game.

To experience what I've done so far:
- space-bar through Professor Pine's dialogue
- speak to everyone in the classroom with space-bar as well
- use the arrow keys to navigate outside
- speak to everyone outside
- press b while facing the 'gloomy' kid on the right outside.
- enjoy a fully coded pokemon battle!
- feel free to change the pokemon and any specifics about them in game_data.py for 'edward 2' (this is your opponent) and main.py's Game.__init__()'s self.player_pokemon at the top of the Game class (your pokemon).
